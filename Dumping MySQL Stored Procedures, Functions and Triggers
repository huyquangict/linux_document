mysqldump will backup by default all the triggers but NOT the stored procedures/functions. There are 2 mysqldump parameters that 
control this behavior:
      —routines – FALSE by default
      —triggers – TRUE by default
      
We need to specify –routines to take backup of stored procedures with data and tables.
Following command will take backup of entire database including stored procedures. For example your database name is “mydb”.
      # mysqldump -u root -p --routines mydb > mydb.sql
      
To take backup of only Stored Procedures and Triggers ( No data and tables ) use following command.
      # mysqldump --routines --no-create-info --no-data --no-create-db --skip-opt mydb > mydb.sql
